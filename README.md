# Contex AI
For Developers, By Developers  
For AI, By AI

There’s a very apparent buzz around AI agents interacting with the world right now, and companies are investing billions in their development, we are literally living in an era of AI Boom. Yet there’s a rudimentary hitch: most of the web as we know it was not designed with AI in mind. We want to take a step to bettering this with Contex: where developers can create customised components tailored for AI traversal or use one from our extensive library, making the web more accessible and inclusive through AI Agents.
